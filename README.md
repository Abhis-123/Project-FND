# Project-FND

## Introduction
We consume news through several mediums throughout the day in our daily routine, but sometimes it becomes difficult to decide which one is fake and which one is authentic.

Do you trust all the news you consume from online media?

Every news that we consume is not real. If you listen to fake news it means you are collecting the wrong information from the world which can affect society because a person’s views or thoughts can change after consuming fake news which the user perceives to be true.

## Project Aim 
The aim of this project is to classify news artiles fake or real 

## Solution 
To get the accurately classified collection of news as real or fake i have build a deep learning  LSTM based model.
